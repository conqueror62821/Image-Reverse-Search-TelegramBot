## About 🌟

Introducing Image Reverse Search, your friendly Telegram bot that helps you
perform reverse image searches for images, videos, and GIFs! 📷🎞️🎉 With support
for a wide range of search engines, you'll get results directly within Telegram
for some, while others will provide an inline button leading you to the engine's
reverse search website. It's like having your personal detective right in your
pocket! 🕵️‍♂️

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository like a pro!
2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in the top-secret
   information.
3. Make sure the treasure trove of the `downloads` folder is accessible via the
   `file_url` provided.
4. Install the bot using the magical command `poetry install`.
5. Finally, unleash the bot with `poetry run start-bots`!

## Parity with Old Version 🕰️

implemented:

- Inline results for Pixiv 🖼️
- Generic SauceNAO results 🌐
- MangaDex 📚
- Anilist 📝
- Trace.moe 🎥
- Generic IQDB results 🌐
