<b><u>ðŸ”Ž Search Engines</u></b>
Search engines are services that provide the actual results of your searched images. They usually only provide sparse data about the found item. Here come the data providers above in play. When possible a search engine provides the result and we fetch more data with a provider above to serve even better results.
Not every search engine however has a convenient way to fetch data from thus only a handful support this bots inline search results (marked below). All others have to be opened manually with the buttons that show up when searching.

Use /tips to get a list of tricks to help you get better search results.
