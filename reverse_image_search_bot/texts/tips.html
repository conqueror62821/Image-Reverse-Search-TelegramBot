<b><u>âœ¨ Tips and Tricks</u></b>

- <b><u>Full Image</u></b>: First of all images should always be uncropped. Most search engines do not support cropped images as it is much harder to search for matches.

- <b><u>Correct Orientation</u></b>: Secondly while many search engines do support rotated images, some do not or are worse at finding results with them. So make sure the images have the correct orientation.

- <b><u>Videos & GIFs</u></b>: When searching for Videos / GIFs we actually search for the first frame in said file. Thus if eg. your video starts with a black screen i you have no chance to find what you want. So it's better sometimes to take a screenshot of said video/GIF at a part when it's easily distinguishable (eg. when a character is visible)

- <b><u>Know where to search</u></b>: Last but not least. Look at /credits to see what each search engines is good at. I also includes recommendations that should help you find the correct search engine. Eg. you wont find a real life person with SauceNAO as it excels in anime/manga related tasks. But on the other hand you will probably find the source of a Manga page much faster than with any other engine.
